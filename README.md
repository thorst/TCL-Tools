# TCL-Tools

Here are a collection of tcl scripts that are general purpose. I will hopefully create another repository with tcl scripts related to the cloverleaf integration engine.

These scripts run on tcl 8.5 specifically. They may work on 8.4 if you have dict installed. I use dict heavily in all my scripts. If you are still stuck on 8.4 or below these scripts may still be worth something as a reference.

  * **_scriptFormat.tcl** - Pretty print (beautify) a tcl script. I use negalfar for linting syntax, but havent found an easy to use formatter, so I wrote my own.
