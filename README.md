# TCL-Tools

Here are a collection of tcl scripts that are general purpose. I will hopefully create another repository with tcl scripts related to the cloverleaf integration engine.

These scripts run on tcl 8.5 specifically. They may work on 8.4 if you have dict installed. I use dict heavily in all my scripts. If you are still stuck on 8.4 or below these scripts may still be worth something as a reference.

Please note this isn't my main repository. My main is private. I will try to remember to keep these up to date. Before you create a pull request let me know, I may have already fixed your issue, but had forgotten to post it.

Feel free to contribute your own scripts, tweak mine, create pull requests, submit bugs...etc

  * **_scriptFormat.tcl** - Pretty print (beautify) a tcl script. I use negalfar for linting syntax, but havent found an easy to use formatter, so I wrote my own.
